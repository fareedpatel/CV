## Fareed Ahmed Patel

An inquisitive and entrepreneurial individual who loves finding solutions to problems, and a people-person that aims to bring out the best in others when working within a team environment.

Recently, I worked as a business development manager for an accountancy practise where I built new relationships with clients, but also generated new forms of revenue by providing business consultancy services.

After University, I worked for a start-up which aimed to revolutionise finance via peer to peer lending as a business analyst, where I realised how technology could be used to change the world. I knew that learning how to code effectively will be pivotal in being at the forefront of technology. In order to achieve this aim, I have recently completed the Makers Academy intensive web development bootcamp to break into the world of tech as a junior developer.

## Skills

#### Web Development

Having recently graduated from Europe’s top development bootcamp, personally I am now ready for the next stage of my career. I would like to apply my new skill-set in a environment where I get to work on solving interesting problems. Below are some of the projects I’ve worked on whilst at Makers Academy;

#### General Skill

I have the ability to work in small groups as well as larger organisations, I’m at my best when I am able to be my most creative self. In my role as a business development manager at SND Accountants I helped a numerous amount of entrepreneurs establishing their start-up by meticulously planning their business. Recently, a plan I wrote for a client looking to start a restaurant called Ginger’s Grill in Wales went [viral] (http://www.walesonline.co.uk/business/business-news/ginger-discount-business-plan-gave-11166602) and received worldwide attention after persuading the owner to offer an interesting discount. I hope to draw this experience, where I am able to to understand the end user in order to build a product, which is outside the box but essentially solves the customers needs.
